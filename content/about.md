![Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen](/images/avatar-real.jpeg "Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen (Felix Nguyen), EE Ph.D. Candidate")

I am Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen, current working as Ph.D Candidate at Autonomous and Soft Robotics (ASR) Laboratory, National Taiwan University, Taiwan. I focus on computer vision, digital signal processing, machine learning and deep learning in various applications.

## Welcome to my blog!
In this blog, I will post small yet interesting notes of knowledge as well as state-of-the-art AI innovation, that I have found during my work as a researcher.

I have done research on convolutional neural networks for computer-aided diagnosis and biosignal processing for various applications. In my current work, I am applying machine learning (supervised & unsupervised) and statistics to business problems. My go-to programming language is Python with the common data science and machine learning stack.
