Do not install any Linux Driver in WSL.\nThe latest NVIDIA Windows GPU Driver will fully support WSL 2. With CUDA support in the driver, existing applications compiled on a Linux system for the same target GPU can run unmodified within the WSL environment. Once NVIDIA Windows GPU Driver is installed in the system, the CUDA driver will be stubbed inside the WSL 2 as libcuda.so. Therefore, you only use a separate CUDA Toolkit for WSL 2 which does not contain the NVIDIA Linux GPU Driver.\n1.

Set up Python environment using Mambaforge Python environment allows to manage separatelly different installations of Python and modules. It is useful when you have many projects running different version of Python and modules. It also help to manage installed modules for publish or reproduce.\nThere are different ways to create a python virtual environment, including built-in venv, Conda and Anaconda.\nConda is a packaging tool and installer that aims to handle library dependencies outside of the Python packages as well as the Python packages themselves. For non preinstalled package manager, Miniconda, an installation of Conda, will be a good option.\nAnaconda is an installation of Conda that comes pre-loaded with a bunch of packages for scientific computing, i.e., numpy, matplotlib, scipy, etc. It also comes with IDE, Jupyter notebooks out of the box. This is helpful for beginers, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t give much control.\nMamba is a package manager which can be used with Python. Unlike Conda, it uses the C/C++ implementation to speed up the package installation. Read more about mamba in here. To install mamba, access its repo and pick the Mabaforge installer for your operating system.\nRemember to run conda init at the end of your installation in your shell to activate the mamba command.\nCreate and use virtual environments The command using mamba is similar to the conda command.\nCreate new environment mamba create -n \u0026lt;envname\u0026gt; python=\u0026lt;version\u0026gt; Activate an environment mamba activate \u0026lt;envname\u0026gt; Deactivate environment mamba deactivate Delete an environment mamba env remove -n \u0026lt;envname\u0026gt; Show all created environments mamba env list Working with Python packages Remember to activate an environment first, do not install any packages in your base environment!\nInstall python packages mamba install \u0026lt;package\u0026gt;[=version] [-c \u0026lt;channelname\u0026gt;] When installing a package, you can optionally indicate specific additional channel that the packages are posted by community. conda-forge is one of most common additional channels.\nDelete packages mamba remove \u0026lt;package\u0026gt; Show all installed packages in the virtual environment mamba list [-n \u0026lt;envname\u0026gt;] Reference Install CUDA and CUDNN on Windows \u0026amp; Linux.

It enables you to execute Linux binaries, use Linux command-line tools, and access Linux file systems from within Windows.\nWhen it comes to machine learning (ML) development, WSL offers several advantages:\nLinux Compatibility: Many ML frameworks, libraries, and tools are primarily developed and optimized for Linux systems. By using WSL, you can seamlessly run Linux-specific ML software on your Windows machine without the need for dual-booting or setting up a separate Linux machine.\nAccess to Linux Packages: WSL provides access to the extensive collection of Linux packages available in various package managers (e.g., APT, YUM, and others). This allows you to easily install and manage Linux dependencies required for your ML projects.\nCommand-Line Tools and Scripts: ML development often involves working with command-line tools and executing scripts. WSL provides a Linux shell environment, enabling you to run Linux commands and scripts directly on your Windows machine. This ensures compatibility and smooth execution of ML workflows that rely on Linux-specific commands and scripts.\nCompatibility with Docker: Docker is widely used in ML development to create isolated environments for running ML applications. WSL provides a seamless integration with Docker, allowing you to run Linux-based Docker containers on your Windows machine without any performance overhead.\nConsistency across Development Environments: If you work in a team where some members use Linux for ML development, using WSL allows you to maintain consistency across different development environments. It ensures that code, scripts, and configurations work consistently regardless of the underlying operating system.\nBy utilizing WSL, you can leverage the power of Linux for ML development while enjoying the convenience of working within the Windows environment. It bridges the gap between Windows and Linux, making it easier to set up and manage a Linux-based ML environment on your Windows machine.\nIt is important to note that WSL is available in different versions, such as WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 2 offers enhanced performance and better integration with the Windows system, making it the recommended choice for ML development. The WSL 2 is fully integrated in Windows 10 build 19041 or Windows 11, so you may consider upgrade your system before install it.\nCheck Windows Version\nYou can check Window version by going to Settings \u0026gt; System \u0026gt; About and scroll down to Windows specifications.\nIf you plan to work with Linux-based ML frameworks, libraries, or tools, using WSL can significantly streamline your development workflow and ensure compatibility with the wider ML community.\n1. PC Requirements WSL 2 uses Hyper-V which requires harware virtualization support enabled in your BIOS. To ensure the hardware virtualization is available on your device, you can check by rebooting, pressing DEL, F2 or F10 (depending on the hardware manufacture) to open the BIOS pannels. Lokking for Virtualization Technology, VTx, Secure Virtual Machine (SVM) or similar options and ensure these options enabled, then reboot the machine.\nDisable Fast Start-up (Optional) Fast start-up saves Windows session and device drivers to a file so the next boot become faster. However, this can cause problems for Linux kernel, which may unresponsive on the next boost. If you encounter this problem, you can disable tthe fast start-up option by Control Panel \u0026gt; Power Options \u0026gt; Choose what the power buttons do \u0026gt; Change settings that are currently unavailable\n2. Install Docker Desktop Docker Desktop with WSL 2 provides an efficient and seamless integration between Docker containers and the WSL 2 environment. This combination allows you to run Linux containers directly on your Windows system, leveraging the power of WSL 2.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t installed Docker Desktop yet, please download and install the Docker Desktop for Windows from the Docker website. Installing Docker Desktop on Windows enables docker and docker-compose in both Windows and WSL 2.\nDocker Desktop suggests you use WSL 2 when it\u0026rsquo;s first launched. Alternatively, you can select Settings from the Docker system tray icon menu, then choose the General tab, check Use the WSL 2 based engine, and hit Apply \u0026amp; Restart. Docker uses the default Linux distro, but you can also enable it in other installed distros from the WSL Integration panel in Settings, then Resources.\nOnce Docker Desktop is installed, you can verify that it is running correctly by following command from PowerShell or Command Prompt:\ndocker version This command displays the Docker version and confirms that Docker is running with WSL 2 integration.\nBy combining Docker Desktop with WSL 2, you can take advantage of the containerization capabilities of Docker while benefiting from the compatibility and performance enhancements of WSL 2. It allows for efficient development and deployment of applications in a Linux environment, even if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a Windows system.\n3. Install Windows Terminal Windows Terminal is a powerful and customizable terminal application for Windows that provides a modern and feature-rich command-line experience. It allows you to interact with various shells and command-line tools in a single window, making it convenient for developers and system administrators. It is available from the Microsoft Store or it repository at github.com/microsoft/terminal/.\nWindows Terminal automatically adds WSL 2 Linux distros when they\u0026rsquo;re installed and offers a configurable range of options including tabs, split views, themes, transparency, and key bindings.\n4. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) To display a list of available WSL Linux distros, you can run followinf command in PowerShell in adminitror mode:\nwsl --list --online To install the default Ubuntu distro (the latest version), run:\nwsl --install If you want to install a specific distro by name, such as Ubuntu-22.04, run:\nwsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04 Install WSL Distros from Microsoft Store Alternaltively, you can install Linux distro from the Microsoft Store.\nOnce the installation is done, you will be prompted to enter a username and password. These are the credentials for Linux administration and completely separately from your Windows username.\nPlease create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match your Windows username. For more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers Enter new UNIX username: Visionbike New password: Retype new password: paddwd: password updated successfully Installation successful! Linux will eventually be ready and your terminal will show content similar to:\nTo run a command as administrator (user \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;), use \u0026#34;sudo \u0026lt;command\u0026gt;\u0026#34;.

The process will depend on the speed of the internet, so be patient if it slow!\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade You can also to check for Linux kernel updates from PowerShell running:\nwsl --update Verify WSL 2 Installation\nTo check if the installation was successful, you can run the following command in PowerShell:\nwsl -l -v NAME STATE VERSION * Ubuntu-22.04 Running 2 docker-desktop Stopped 2 docker-desktop-data Stopped 2 5. Working with WSL 2 Set a Default Linux Distribution If you have more than one WSL Linu distro, you need to set the most frequent used distro as a default one. To set the default distro, run the following command in PowerShell temrinal.\nwsl --setdefault \u0026lt;DISTRONAME\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;DISTRONAME\u0026gt; is the distro\u0026rsquo;s name you installed.\nFile System in WLS 2 In WSL 2, the Linux file system is located within the WSL 2 virtual machine. It provides a Linux-compatible file system hierarchy, including the root directory (/) and various standard directories, such as /home, /usr, and /var. These directories and their subdirectories contain the files and directories specific to the Linux environment.\nThe WSL 2 file system integration ensures that Linux processes can access and manipulate files stored on the Windows file system. This means you can work with files and directories in both the Linux and Windows environments seamlessly. For example, you can create, modify, and delete files from within WSL 2, and those changes will be reflected in the corresponding Windows directories and vice versa.\nWindows drives are mounted in the Linux /mnt/ directory. For instance, you can access Users folder a C:\\User\\ by running in WSL terminal:\ncd /mnt/c/Users/ Noting that accessing Windows files from Linux is considerably slower than using the native Linux file system. Where possible, create projects in the Linux file space, typically in your home folder (/home/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; or ~).\nYou can also access WSL 2 files from the network path \\\\wsl$\\ in Windows\u0026rsquo;s File Explorer.\nCreate Linux symbolic link for Windows folder For ease of access, you can create a Linux symbolic link to any Windows folder from the terminal. For example, for C:\\projects\\:\ncd ~ ln -s /mnt/d/projects/ A projects folder will appear in your Linux home directory. Navigate to it using cd ~/project and you\u0026rsquo;ll actually be in /mnt/d/projects/, which maps directly to D:\\projects\\.\nMove or Clone Your WSL Linux Disk Image WSL Linux disk images are installed on your C: drive in deault. This may occupy a lot of space in the Windows\u0026rsquo;s system drive. Optionally, you can either move it to another drive to free up space on C:, or use the same image to create multiple Linux installations (which can be useful if you need different applications and setups for different projects - although Docker may be more practical).\nPresume that you are moving the Ubuntu Linux distro to D:\\wsl. In a Powershell terminal, then export Linux distro you want to move by name to a backup .tar file, such as D:\\backup\\ubuntu-22.04.tar.\nmkdir D:\\backup wsl --expoer Ubuntu-22.04 D:\\backup\\ubuntu-22.04.tar Then, unregister that distro to remove it by name from the C: drive.\nwsl --unregister Ubuntu-22.04 You can run wsl -l to verify the distro has been removed. Now, you can import the new WSL 2 distro at another location, such as D:\\wsl.\nmkdir D:\\wsl wsl --import Ubuntu-22.04 D:\\wsl\\ D:\\backup\\ubuntu-22.04.tar You can make any number of named clones from the same back-up by changing the name of distro after --import argument.\nAgain, verify the WSL distro has been successfully created by wsl -l command. At this point, Ubuntu will use root as the default user. To revert to your own account, run the following command:\nubuntu config --default-user \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; is the username you defined before.\nFor other distros that aren\u0026rsquo;t the WSL2 default distro, you need to log on to the distro and create/edit /etc/wsl.conf file.\nnano /etc/wsl.conf Add the following lines to the file\n[user] default=\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; Save the file, then restart the distro in PowerShell terminal.\nwsl --terminate \u0026lt;DISTRONAME\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;DISTRONAME\u0026gt; is the distro\u0026rsquo;s name you installed. Now you can feel free to delete backup file if you want.\nSave \u0026amp; Exit \u0026#34;nano\u0026#34; editor To save the file use Ctrl + S combination while Ctrl + X is use to exit the editor in terminal.\nVisual Studio Code with WSL 2 Integration Visual Studio Code (VS Code) permits you to use any Windows or Linux terminal. In VS Code, you need to install WSL extension (search in Extensions tab). The WSL extension enables you to run VS Code within the WSL.\nWhen the WSL extension si installed, you will see a new Remote Status bar item at the far left.\nThe Remote Status bar item can quickly show you in which context VS Code is running (local or remote).\nTo open new remote WSL window, you can press F1 to open Command Pallete in VS C and type WSL to select the option.\nConclusion Working with WSL 2 on Windows 11 offers an improved experience for running Linux applications. With WSL 2, you can seamlessly integrate Windows and Linux environments, allowing you to develop and execute code using Windows tools while leveraging the power of a Linux-based runtime. This integration simplifies web development, eliminates the need for virtual machines, and provides a more efficient workflow. Overall, WSL 2 on Windows 11 offers the benefits of both operating systems, enhancing productivity and making it easier to work with Linux applications on a Windows platform.\nReference Windows Subsystem for Linux Documentation.

Ideally, these goals need to be achieved when creating and mantaining a blog:\nLow-cost - Free or as close to free as posisble. Productive - Easy to write and maintain. Cloud Native - Utilizes public cloud services for hosting, allowing for infinite scaling. After researching, I found that using Markdown, Hugo and GitHub Pages is indeed a powerful combination for creating and maintaining a cost-effective, productive, and cloud-native blog.\nMarkdown is markup language that is extremely easy to read, write natively and can be converted into HTML. Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go language that allows for content written in Markdown to be rendered into HTML webpages. GitHub Pages is the GitHub service that hosts web contentstored in a GitHub repository. In this post, I will show how to create an simple personal blog for FREE using above technologies. The blog was developed in Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an outline of the steps you can follow to create the personal blog using these technologies:\n1. Setting up GitHub Account If you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, creating a GitHub account. GitHub Pages allows you to host your blog for free using a GitHub repository.\n2. Installing Hugo Before starting, make sure git is installed in the local machine.\nsudo apt install -y git Configure Git with your username and email address.\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;your.email@example.com\u0026#34; To verify that Git has been installed successfully, you can check the version using git --version. This command will display the installed version of Git.\nFor Ubuntu user, you can install Hugo on your host by this command:\nsudo apt install -y hugo Run the folloing command for verification:\nhugo version The Hugo version should be shown if the installation is successfull.\nhugo v0.92.2+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2023-01-31T11:11:57Z VendorInfo=ubuntu:0.92.2-1ubuntu0.1 3. Creating a new Hugo site You can run hugo new site command to create a new Hugo site:\nhugo new site \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;-hugo -f yml This command will set up the basic directory structure and configuration file in *.yml format for your blog.\nWhat is `\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;`?\nFor convenient management and organization, you should name the your blog project as above format with \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; as the your GitHub\u0026rsquo;s username, i.e., visionbike-hugo. It\u0026rsquo;s helpful to keep track your project and ensuring clarity when managing multiple repositories.\nThe site will be associated with a GitHub repository where you can store the source code of your blog. Hence, you need to initialize git in the local project for further use.\ncd \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;-hugo git init You also need to create a new repository on GitHub storage for your blog\u0026rsquo;s source code.\nCreating Github Repository Without README\nBy creating a repository without a README file, you can avoid accidental history conflicts when pushing your local project to a fresh repository. You can always add a README file later if needed.\nNow, you link the local project to the GitHub repository by the git remote command:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io.git git banrch -M master By completing these steps, you have linked your local Hugo site to the GitHub repository. Now you can continue working on your site locally, commit any changes, and push them to the remote repository when ready.\n4. Installing Hugo Theme Installing a Hugo theme is a fantastic way to personalize your blog and enhance its visual appeal. You can access free Hugo themes via this website.\nFor my blog, I chose the PaperModX theme because of fonding its style and awesome features. I added its source code by the git submodule command.\ngit submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX themes/PaperModX The command will add the PaperModX theme repository as a submodule in the themes/PaperModX directory of your Hugo site.\nUpdating submodules\nIf you have already added the submodule before, you can run the following command to reclone it.\ngit submodule update --init --recursive For updating the theme, run this command.\ngit submodule update --remote --merge 5. Modify Hugo Configuration Once you have added the theme, you can configure it in your Hugo site\u0026rsquo;s configuration file (config.yml). Refer to the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation for specific instructions on customization and configuration options. You will most likely want to modify the following fields:\nbaseURL: This should be set into the URL GitHub Pages for hosting your blog. If the GitHub repository is named \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io, then the value of baseURL will be https://\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io/. If the GitHub repository has any other name, then the value will be https://\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026lt;REPOSITORY_NAME\u0026gt;/. For instance, my GitHub username is visionbike, then:\nIf the GitHub repository is named visionbike.github.io, then the baseURL will be https://visionbike.github.io/. If the GitHub repository is named visionbike-hugo, then the baseURL will be https://visionbike.github.io/visionbike-hugo/. title: This will be the title of your blog site as it appears at the top of a visitorâ€™s web browser when your site is open. It will also appear underneath your avatar, if one is present.\ntheme: The name of the theme Hugo should use to render your site. In my example, this will be set to PaperModX, since that is the name of the theme I am using.\nExample contents of a valid config.yml file can be found below.\nconfig.yml # base URL baseURL: \u0026#34;http://visionbike.github.io/\u0026#34; # site title title: \u0026#34;Visionbike - Personal Blog of CV | DSP | ML notes\u0026#34; # paginate paginate: 5 # theme config theme: \u0026#34;PaperModX\u0026#34; themesdir: \u0026#34;themes\u0026#34; # global config enableInlineShortcodes: true enableRobotsTXT: true buildDrafts: false buildFuture: false buildExpired: false enableEmoji: true # css minify for speeding up site minify: disableXML: true minifyOutput: true # site param config params: # environment env: \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;Visionbike - Personal Blog of CV | DSP | ML notes\u0026#34; # color scheme: auto, dark, light defaultTheme: \u0026#34;dark\u0026#34; disableThemeToggle: true # header logo logo: text: \u0026#34;Visionbike\u0026#34; icon: \u0026#34;images/apple-touch-icon.png\u0026#34; iconHeight: 35 iconWidth: 35 # profile-mode profileMode: enabled: true title: \u0026#34;Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen\u0026#34; subtitle: \u0026#34;AI Researcher - Personal Blog of CV | DSP | ML notes\u0026#34; imageUrl: \u0026#34;images/avatar-real.png\u0026#34; imageTitle: \u0026#34;avatar-real\u0026#34; imageWidth: 180 imageHeight: 180 buttons: - name: Archives url: /archives/ - name: Tags url: /tags/ # home-info-mode homeInfoParams: title: \u0026#34;Phuc Thanh-Thien Nguyen\u0026#34; content: \u0026#34;AI Researcher - Personal Blog of CV | DSP | ML notes\u0026#34; # home social icons socialIcons: - name: github url: \u0026#34;https://github.com/visionbike/\u0026#34; - name: linkedIn url: \u0026#34;https://linkedin.com/in/nttphuc/\u0026#34; # post config author: \u0026#34;Visionbike\u0026#34; showCodeCopyButtons: true displayFullLangName: true showReadingTime: true showWordCount: true showPostNavLinks: true showBreadCrumbs: true enableImageZoom: true # assets images assets: # disableFingerprinting: true favicon: \u0026#34;images/favicon.ico\u0026#34; favicon16x16: \u0026#34;images/favicon-16x16.png\u0026#34; favicon32x32: \u0026#34;images/favicon-32x32.png\u0026#34; appleTouchIcon: \u0026#34;images/apple-touch-icon.png\u0026#34; safarPinnedTab: \u0026#34;images/safari-pinned-tab.svg\u0026#34; # search page fuseOpts: isCaseSensitive: false shouldSort: true location: 0 distance: 1000 threshold: 0.4 minMatchCharLength: 0 keys: [\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;permalink\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;] # laguage config languages: en: weight: 1 # language code languageCode: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; # determines default content language: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;zh-cn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vi\u0026#34;, ... defaultContentLanguage: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; # menu language menu: main: - name: \u0026#34;Posts\u0026#34; weight: 1 url: \u0026#34;/posts/\u0026#34; - name: \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; url: \u0026#34;/tags/\u0026#34; weight: 3 - name: \u0026#34;Archive\u0026#34; url: \u0026#34;/archives/\u0026#34; weight: 4 - name: \u0026#34;Publish\u0026#34; url: \u0026#34;/publish/\u0026#34; weight: 5 - name: \u0026#34;About\u0026#34; weight: 10 url: \u0026#34;/about/\u0026#34; - name: \u0026#34;Search\u0026#34; weight: 100 url: \u0026#34;/search/\u0026#34; # for search page outputs: home: - HTML - RSS - JSON # syntax highlight pygmentsUseClasses: true pygmentsCodeFences: true markup: goldmark: renderer: unsafe: true highlight: lineNos: false codeFences: true noClasses: false After modifying the configuration file accordingly, you can commit and push changes from your local repository to GitHub.\ngit add config.yml git commit -m \u0026#34;modify configuration file\u0026#34; git push -u origin master 6. Creating New Hugo Post You are almost done finishing your personal blog!\nTo create the first post, you execute the hugo new command in the terminal.\nhugo new posts/first-post/index.md The command will create a new folder named first-post with new Markdown file index.md, inside the content/posts directory. Creating a new directory for each single post helps you manage your resource better when images, media sources can be store directly in this directory. The Markdown file will contain the template for your first blog post and you can start writing your content using Markdown syntax.\nThe contents of the first-post.md file will look like as:\nfirst-post.md\n--- title: \u0026#34;First Post\u0026#34; date: 2023-07-04T01:53:57+08:00 draft: true --- You need to add content to the Markdown file and update the metadata header. In the metadata header, you will find information such as the post\u0026rsquo;s title (title), publishing date (date), and draft status (draft). Change the value of the draft field from true to false to indicate that the post is ready to be published on your blog site. Your can also add other features supported by the installed theme for your post, i.e., comments, share buttons, navigation, etc.\nThe, you add the desired content to the body of the post. For instance, I added the line \u0026ldquo;This is my first post! Hello world!\u0026rdquo; at the bottom of the file. Feel free to customize the content to reflect your own thoughts and ideas in Markdown syntax.\nAfter modifying the first blog post, you can use git commit to commit and push the changes from your local repository to GitHub.\ngit add content/posts/first-post.md git commit -m \u0026#34;add the first post\u0026#34; git push -u origin master 7. Testing the Hugo Configuration Before hosting your blog to GitHub pages, make ensure Hugo can parse the configuration file and build our new blog post successfully.\nIn the local machine, you can run hugo server command to serve your site locally.\nhugo server --disableFastRender It will watch for any changes in your files and automatically rebuild your site whenever there are updates. Hugo will provide a local development server address, i.e., http://localhost:1313, where you can access your site locally.\nTo parse the configuration and build your site, you simply run hugo command.\nhugo If Hugo encounters any errors, they will be reported here. If the site is successfully built, then you will see output similar to the following.\nStart building sites â€¦ hugo v0.92.2+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2023-01-31T11:11:57Z VendorInfo=ubuntu:0.92.2-1ubuntu0.1 | EN -------------------+----- Pages | 13 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 0 Static files | 18 Processed images | 0 Aliases | 0 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Total in 38 ms 8. Setting Up GitHub Actions Workflow Lastly, the GitHub Actions workflow has to be prepared for automatically building and deploying your blog to GitHub Pages. This workflow is defined by a YAML file in the .github/workflows directory structure at the root of the project.\nFirst, create the workflows directory.\nmkdir -p .github/workflows The command will create the .github/workflows directory if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist. The -p option ensures that the parent directories are created if needed.\nThen, we create a new file within the created folder directory, named deploy_gh_pages.yaml with the following contents.\ndeploy_gh_pages.yaml\n--- --- name: Deploy Hugo site via GitHub Pages on: push: branches: - master # Set a branch to deploy pull_request: jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-22.04 permissions: contents: write concurrency: group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }} steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34; extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 # If you\u0026#39;re changing the branch from main, # also change the `master` in `refs/heads/master` # below accordingly. if: github.ref == \u0026#39;refs/heads/master\u0026#39; with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public The YAML file sets up the deployment process using Hugo and GitHub Pages. The workflow is triggered on a push to the master branch, and it uses the specified actions to build and deploy your blog. You can find more in this.\nFinally, we use git commands to commit and push the changes from your local repository to GitHub.\ngit add .github/workflows/deploy_gh_pages.yaml git commit -m \u0026#34;Add GitHub Actions workflow\u0026#34; git push -u origin master 9. Configuring GitHub Pages The GitHub Pages will allow GitHub to build automatically and serve our website whenever changes are made to the underlying repository.\nFirst, we create new branch named gh-page. This branch will be used by GitHub Pages to build and serve your website. You can create the branch using the branch creation feature in your GitHub repository.\nThen, go to the Settings tab near the top of your repository.\nIn the left hand pane, locate and click on the Pages category.\nBy default, GitHub Pages will be disabled for your repository. To enable it, we need to select a branch for GitHub Pages to build and serve our website from. Under the Source section in the middle pane, you will see a dropdown menu labeled None. Click on the dropdown menu and select the gh-pages branch. This tells GitHub Pages to build and serve your website from the gh-pages branch.\nAfter selecting the deployment branch, you will see a notification indicating where your site will be published. It will provide you with a URL where your website can be accessed.\nWait for a few minutes to allow GitHub Pages to build and deploy your website. When the deployment completes, you can click on the URL provided in the notification to view your website. It may take some time for the changes to propagate and for your website to become accessible.\nConclusion Congratulations on setting up your blog using Hugo, Markdown, and GitHub Pages!
